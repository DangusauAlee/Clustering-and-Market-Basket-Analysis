# Clustering-and-Market-Basket-Analysis
The retail industry boasts a wealth of data, given that its core operations revolve around sales and revenue generation. Sales analysis plays a pivotal role in extracting valuable insights for the retail sector, encompassing factors such as identifying high-demand products, understanding high-traffic demographics, and tracking the evolution of sales trends over time. These insights are instrumental in driving revenue growth and establishing measurable metrics for performance evaluation.

To harness the full potential of these key drivers, it is imperative to optimize customer engagement by leveraging their purchasing patterns. A strategic approach involves categorizing customers into clusters based on their unique purchasing behaviors. This clustering enables the tailoring of products and services to align with the characteristics of each customer group.

One effective technique that has stood the test of time in this domain is market basket analysis. This method facilitates product recommendations by examining both customer clusters and their historical purchasing patterns. By leveraging market basket analysis, retailers can enhance customer experiences and drive revenue growth.

In the scope of this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sales and revenue data, performed customer segmentation through clustering techniques, and applied market basket analysis to recommend products based on customer clusters.
